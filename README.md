# ReactJS Search Engine 
A client built using ReactJS for my project [searchEngine] (https://github.com/Tharindu-h/searchEngine)

## Details
- I created this React client to help me learn ReactJS.
- This app uses the REST API from the [searchEngine] (https://github.com/Tharindu-h/searchEngine) project.
- I also wanted to learn about Docker so I "dockerized" both this project as well as [searchEngine] (https://github.com/Tharindu-h/searchEngine) Project.
